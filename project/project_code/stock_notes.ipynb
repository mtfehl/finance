    "\n",
    "We make use of the built-in yfinance library. However, I quickly found out there was a lot of issues when trying to use the .info() method call on any given ticker, which made the initial phase of the project much more difficult than anticipated. I browsed on the internet to read about different ways to download stock data, and the .download() method call and .history() method call seemed to be the most effective choices. The first part of this is shown below, where these two functions would allow someone to input a ticker -- the difficult part I had to figure out how to solve was when there was a ticker that did not exist on the stock market, \"APAL\" is an example."

    "This code was fine to start with, but I quickly realized after creating it that I would need to be able to test for multiple inputted tickers so that an investor can view them all in a table, side-by-side. Thus, I had to mess with the code in order to convert the given input (which is a string) and convert it into a list of strings, so that I can go through each ticker and determine if it existed in the yfinance library, same as before. The undelimit function is one that I imported from my comp110 class that we made & reviewed on a quiz. I struggled a lot with this part initially, but once I realized I had to convert the `str` to a `list[str]`, I was able to tackle this part much quicker."
