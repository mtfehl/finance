# This project in one in quantitative finance where we will be applying python code to attempt to manipulate data from various ETFs
# We will evaluate data from many inputted ticker from the S&P500
# We will extrapolate each associated std, returns, sharpe ratio, kurtosis, skew and display it on a easy-to-digest chart
# We will be able to cross-reference two stocks/etfs against one another, and based on the calculations, decide which investment is most optimal (sharpe ratio)
# We can also try to account for risk preference of the individual to find the optimal rate of investment in the various ETF's and the risk-free asset
# We will plot and inputted tickers onto a graph onto each other for the user to choose what to compare
