# to run a program, add main() function
# make sure you add if statement of: if __name__ == "__main__", and the result is: main()
# This will run the function without being in python by typing: python -m comp110.lessons.ls12_8ball, or whatever path
# If you want to test certain functions, you can run python, then typing "from folder.folder.file import (function name)"
# Now you will be able to test your functions you defined
