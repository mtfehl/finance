# Basketball game using dicts and teams
# shooting using rand int to gauge percentage
# can make subs by appending dict/editing

# TO DO
# Create two basketball rosters by filling dictionaries
# Make name & jersey number
# Charlotte & Golden State

# Each player has own shooting stats and abilities -- shot percentage, steal, dunk, etc.

# Create pathways to maake decisions for players
# For example, if you are dribbling with curry, we can choose to shoot, dribble, pass, etc.
# We can eventually make it more accurate with better stats, but for now we need it to function with simple decision-making

# Make substitutes for players
